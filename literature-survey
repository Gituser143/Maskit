Abstract
========

Following months of lock-down in an attempt to lower cases of COVID-19, authorities world-wide have begun reopening their economies. Although cities are being unlocked and people are let out, prevention of further spread of the virus is crucial.

Intro
=====

In order to facilitate further spread of the virus, certain rules have been formulated for the people to follow in public spaces. One of the key rules being, the need to wear a facial mask in public to avoid direct transmission of the virus. Although imposed, the rule has been taken for granted in a majority of cases.

To help impose the rule and ensure it is followed in public spaces like office workspaces, malls, etc., we aim to build an IoT based system which can check whether a person is wearing a mask or not and allow/deny them entry on the same basis.
